# Best Goods - Short for BEGS
Using QR codes or a similar approach, propose an interactive application to be deployed on a smart device (tablet, mobile phone, watch, fridge, TV, vehicle, etc. – at least 3 of them) able to recommend best products – considering quality, price, various restrictions,... – for a set of desired goodies, including several information of interest: characteristics, price, geographic availability, risk factors, etc. The application will also recommend products/services on the basis of the user's social graph (his/her "friends" on a social network).
