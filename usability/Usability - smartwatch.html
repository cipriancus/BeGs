			<div class="usabilityTestBackground">				
				<h4>Persona Type Tested: <span>Primary/Secondary/Negative/Served</span></h4>
				<h5>Context: <span>A meeting room from the office</span> </h5>
				<h5>Duration: <span>60 minutes</span></h5>
				<p>Complete the following before starting: <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/testingscript.html">Greeting and Consent</a> &amp; <a href="https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/usability/userbackground.html">User Background Information</a>.</p>

		<div class="usabilityTestObjectives">
				<h5>Overall Objectives</h5>
				<p>List the objectives/goals of the usability test; what you want to study or to evaluate. Be specific in what you want achieve, to evaluate with this test (e.g. obtain quality or quantitative regarding certain product/application components, accessibility evaluation, heuristic evaluation, cognitive walk-through etc.).
				</p><ul>
					<li>What is the user's opinion about the main page from <strong>Begs Smartwatch application</strong> </li>
					<li>How intuitive the wishlist is?;</li>
					<li>How do the chosen colors look like?;</li>
				
				</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestScenarios">
			<h5>Scenario</h5>
			<p>Use one scenario for each test. <strong>Do not use multiple scenarios for a usability test as it can confuse and frustrate the user</strong>. The scenarios used in the usability tests have a direct connection with the scenarios built for the <a href="http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~stefan.negru/personas/">personas document</a>. </p>
		<p>In the first scenario, the user has the first interaction with the mobile application. This first interaction will have a welcome page that will redirect it to the main page. You will find the main categories and recommendations used, as well as the main menu of the application. During this flow, you will find the moving image.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="usabilityTestDetails">
			<div class="detailsLeft">
				<h5>Tasks</h5>
					<p>Write out the tasks for each persona type. <strong>Avoid complex tasks.</strong> Make sure the user is able to complete the test in the specified time interval. Assign an estimated completion time for each task.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How do you find the recommendations for products? <span>30sec</span>;</li>
						<li>How can you see new products?<span> 40sec</span>;</li>
						<li>On what ranks is the "Recommendations" category?<span> 30sec</span>;</li>
						<li>Which image on the main page is in motion?<span> 50sec</span>;</li>
						<li>On what ranks is the "Recommendations" category?<span>30sec</span>;</li>
						
					</ul>
					<p>A user might complete a task in a shorter or greater time than the <strong>estimated time</strong>. If the <strong>completion time</strong> exceeds the estimated time then it there is a problem. Also a user might skip the current task thus the <strong>completion time</strong> would be <strong>0</strong>. </p>
				<h5>Post-test Questions</h5>
					<p>These questions could be presented to the user as a questionnaire or verbally asked.</p>			
					<ul>
						<li>How difficult was it to find the main menu?</li>
						<li>What was the first impression when you opened the application?;</li>
						<li>Did you feel in difficulty finding the new product list?</li>
						<li>As many questions needed.</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they are thinking, about the task or the product/application;</li>
					<li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
					<li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;</li>
					<li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test Observations section accompanied by video/audio).</li>
					<li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with: "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".</li>

			<h5>Other Notes</h5>
			<p>Written/video/audio notes done attached to the usability test. These notes reflect the user thoughts and frustrations.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Users with less experience in using mobile apps have been confused when the product categories have been found</li>
			<li>Users with more experience in using mobile apps had a facial expression excited about the first interaction with the application and were curious to use it.</li>

			<h5>Post-test Questions Answers</h5>
			<p>Before the test write down some expected answers to these questions in order to compare them with the user's answers. Another solution is to establish the expected answers by using a control user.</p>
