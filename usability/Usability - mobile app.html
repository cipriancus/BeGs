                <ul>
                    <li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they
                        are thinking, about the task or the product/application;
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
                    <li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a
                        sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;
                    </li>
                    <li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test
                        Observations section accompanied by video/audio).
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with:
                        "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".
