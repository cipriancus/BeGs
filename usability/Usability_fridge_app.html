            <p>For the first scenario, users will interact with the simulated refrigerator application in a browser
                through a web application. The interaction will be small because with the refrigerator the user will
                have the possibility to choose from the list of products the food they want and put them in the wish
                list. He can see product details and give up a product he no longer wants.</p>

                    <li>What was the first impression when you saw the refrigerator screen?</li>

                <h5>Notes for Test Coordinator</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remind the user that you would like them to 'think aloud' so that you can understand what they
                        are thinking, about the task or the product/application;
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the user the scenario for the test;</li>
                    <li>Read the user the tasks he has to complete. If the tasks are complex, you may want to put a
                        sheet of paper in front of the user with each task written out;
                    </li>
                    <li>Record the user's actions, comments, questions, and body language (write them in the Test
                        Observations section accompanied by video/audio).
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't offer help; let the user attempt to perform the task. If they ask for help reply with:
                        "What do you think you/that would do?" "What do you think that means?".
                    </li>
