          Using QR codes or a similar approach, propose an interactive application to be deployed on a smart device 
		  (tablet, mobile phone, watch, fridge, TV, vehicle, etc. – at least 3 of them) able to recommend best products –
		  considering quality, price, various restrictions,... – for a set of desired goodies, including several information of interest: 
		  characteristics, price, geographic availability, risk factors, etc. The application will also recommend products/services on the 
		  basis of the user's social graph (his/her "friends" on a social network).

            <h1>3 Product</h1>
			<p>
				Begs is a platform that gives users suggestions about food and eating habits.
			</p>
            <p>
				The purpose of the application is to recommend to users the most advantageous 
				products according to the selected criteria, their restrictions (may restrict a
				manufacturer, ingredients inside the product and if they are necessarily valid 
				in their geographical area).
            </p>
			<p>
				Each user can make a profile, with different food preferences and restrictions 
				or preferences (such as preferring whole grain products compared to other 
				cereals). Among the restrictions may be a certain ingredient in products, 
				may restrict or prefer a particular producer, may specify which type of 
				producer he wants (only locally, bio, SME, supermarket).
			</p>
			<p>
				This app tries to recommend users the healthiest products and give them the ability 
				to give a product rating or add comments to inform other people about different aspects 
				of the product. Users can also distribute content to social media platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Manufacturers have a virtual marketplace where they can sell their products and have a list of promotional campaigns. 
				Each manufacturer also has a score that users can give for several aspects: how organic the ingredients are used,
				how good the service is, the local validity, the delivery time. 
				Manufacturers will also be provided with individual store analysis solutions to optimize their content based on previous results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Users can scan products using QR code, barcode, or search by product name, either to search for them in the app or to add them (if they have not been added already ).
			</p>
			<p>
				Begs aggregates data from multiple online stores to find users at discounted prices.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app can be used with a smart fridge to mark what products are needed with your tablet or phone when they are shopping or with a watch to see the shopping list easier.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application gives bio, local and SME manufacturers the opportunity to list their products for users to be informed about them.
			</p>
			<p>
				The app suggests certain products using the activity of friends using social media.

            <h1>4 Features</h1>
			<p>
				The app wishes to provide the following features for consumers:
			</p>
            <ul>
				<li>Aggregates data from multiple online stores to find users at discounted prices.</li>
				<li>A single search looks for the inventory of all Begs affiliated stores.</li>

			</ul>
			<p>
				The app wishes to provide the following features for sellers:
			</p>
            <ul>
				<li>I can record on the Begs platform, which helps people discover my business</li>

			<p>
				Features that will be added in the future as growth potential:
			</p>
            <ul>
				<li>I buy from multiple stores in one place and the company delivers them.</li>
				<li>Using application usage data, we can enter various markets to provide a service:
				home delivery, products, and more.
				We will know where to send the merchandise and what type, what buyers in zone X prefer
				and we can help small producers make certain decisions, analytics.</li>
				<li>Crawler social networks to identify food trends.</li>
				<li>Connect to various fitness apps that retrieve data from Google Fit 
				and suggest the user whether he needs hydration, carbohydrates, 
				or recommends a diet specific to the training types followed.</li>

				<li>Un sistem de recompense virtuale pentru utilizatori ce faciliteaza 
				fidelizarea lor (e.g. Badge pentru o alimentatie diversificata ~ 100 produse din categorii diferite)</li>
				<li>The "Boost IMM" program → every week we expose one manufacturer at the beginning and why we chose it, 
				which good products it has to increase awareness among all customers as a free ad.</li>
				<li>"Bestseller" program → every month we choose the best seller based on the quality of the products checked using user reviews.</li>

			<p>In order to build and define the identity of our application we have set a representative color that will remain in the minds of the users. Starting from the green color, we chose the Complementary pattern and we began to define the representative colors of the application.</p>
			<p>To achieve this goal we used the colorizer.org application that suggests the color palette of each design pattern</p>

				The representative logo for our application is built from a suggestive icon that signifies the shopping cart, followed by the name of the application <italic>Begs</italic> and the application slogan Best Food.
			</p>
			<p>In order to find the most suitable representative logo, we have gone through 5 main steps. </p>
			<embed src="scholarly/Photos/brand-diagram.png"  class="brand-diagram" width="400px" height="200px">
			<ul>
				<li>The first step was to find a simple and suggestive design for the application.</li>
				<li> To be memorable, we chose a main image, a shopping cart that is easy to remember in mind by customers. 
				We chose a green color palette because it suggests health, energy and care for nature</li>
				<li>In order to respect the principle of timeless we chose a common icon, the shopping cart, which is marked by a smile</li>
				<li> From the point of view of versatility, this logo will be assigned to the phone, refrigerator and smartwatch</li>
				<li>The aforementioned principles ensure that the chosen log has an appropriate design.</li>
