            Using QR codes or a similar approach, propose an interactive application to be deployed on a smart device
            (tablet, mobile phone, watch, fridge, TV, vehicle, etc. – at least 3 of them) able to recommend best
            products –
            considering quality, price, various restrictions,... – for a set of desired goodies, including several
            information of interest:
            characteristics, price, geographic availability, risk factors, etc. The application will also recommend
            products/services on the
            basis of the user's social graph (his/her "friends" on a social network).

        <p>
            Begs is a platform that gives users suggestions about food and eating habits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the application is to recommend to users the most advantageous
            products according to the selected criteria, their restrictions (may restrict a
            manufacturer, ingredients inside the product and if they are necessarily valid
            in their geographical area).
        </p>
        <p>
            Each user can make a profile, with different food preferences and restrictions
            or preferences (such as preferring whole grain products compared to other
            cereals). Among the restrictions may be a certain ingredient in products,
            may restrict or prefer a particular producer, may specify which type of
            producer he wants (only locally, bio, SME, supermarket).
        </p>
        <p>
            This app tries to recommend users the healthiest products and give them the ability
            to give a product rating or add comments to inform other people about different aspects
            of the product. Users can also distribute content to social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manufacturers have a virtual marketplace where they can sell their products and have a list of promotional
            campaigns.
            Each manufacturer also has a score that users can give for several aspects: how organic the ingredients are
            used,
            how good the service is, the local validity, the delivery time.
            Manufacturers will also be provided with individual store analysis solutions to optimize their content based
            on previous results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can scan products using QR code, barcode, or search by product name, either to search for them in the
            app or to add them (if they have not been added already ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Begs aggregates data from multiple online stores to find users at discounted prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app can be used with a smart fridge to mark what products are needed with your tablet or phone when they
            are shopping or with a watch to see the shopping list easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application gives bio, local and SME manufacturers the opportunity to list their products for users to
            be informed about them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app suggests certain products using the activity of friends using social media.

        <h3>
            6.1 Brand
        </h3>
        <p>Begs aims to follow the following principles in order to build a sustainable brand</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> the choice of a good color palette is very important in branding. Color isn’t
                just aesthetics, it stimulates various emotions and carries with it subconscious associations to various
                things and characteristics.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Character</strong> many people in commercialized societies use products and brands to define
                themselves, so shape brand’s character towards something which audience will like to associate
                themselves with.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emotion</strong> uses vibrant colors and beautiful imagery to create a rich and exciting brand
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong> throughout design is based on the choices we made earlier in selecting the
                right personality for the brand and evoking the appropriate emotions. Keep consistent colors, visuals
                and printing in full to ensure that the site projects a uniform image.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uniqueness</strong> through the proposed design, we will offer unique product creation, which
                will be remembered among users and will be easier to remember in their minds
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            6.2 Identity
        </h3>
        <p>In order to build and define the identity of our application we have set a representative color that will
            remain in the minds of the users. Starting from the green color, we chose the Complementary pattern and we
            began to define the representative colors of the application.</p>
        <p>To achieve this goal we used the colorizer.org application that suggests the color palette of each design
            pattern</p>
        <p>We chose the colors using the complementary method, thus, the colors as as follows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: (242,254,217) and complementary being: (229,217,254)</li>
            <li>Buttons: (177,227,77) and complementary being: (127,77,227)</li>
            <li>Border: (140,59,59) and complementary being: (59,140,140)</li>
            <li>Text: (0,0,0) and complementary being: (0,0,0)</li>

            <li>The first step was to find a simple and suggestive design for the application.</li>
            <li> To be memorable, we chose a main image, a shopping cart that is easy to remember in mind by customers.
                We chose a green color palette because it suggests health, energy and care for nature
            </li>
            <li>In order to respect the principle of timeless we chose a common icon, the shopping cart, which is marked
