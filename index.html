            Using QR codes or a similar approach, propose an interactive application to be deployed on a smart device
            (tablet, mobile phone, watch, fridge, TV, vehicle, etc. – at least 3 of them) able to recommend best
            products –
            considering quality, price, various restrictions,... – for a set of desired goodies, including several
            information of interest:
            characteristics, price, geographic availability, risk factors, etc. The application will also recommend
            products/services on the
            basis of the user's social graph (his/her "friends" on a social network).

        <h1>3 Product</h1>
        <p>
            Begs is a platform that gives users suggestions about food and eating habits.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of the application is to recommend to users the most advantageous
            products according to the selected criteria, their restrictions (may restrict a
            manufacturer, ingredients inside the product and if they are necessarily valid
            in their geographical area).
        </p>
        <p>
            Each user can make a profile, with different food preferences and restrictions
            or preferences (such as preferring whole grain products compared to other
            cereals). Among the restrictions may be a certain ingredient in products,
            may restrict or prefer a particular producer, may specify which type of
            producer he wants (only locally, bio, SME, supermarket).
        </p>
        <p>
            This app tries to recommend users the healthiest products and give them the ability
            to give a product rating or add comments to inform other people about different aspects
            of the product. Users can also distribute content to social media platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manufacturers have a virtual marketplace where they can sell their products and have a list of promotional
            campaigns.
            Each manufacturer also has a score that users can give for several aspects: how organic the ingredients are
            used,
            how good the service is, the local validity, the delivery time.
            Manufacturers will also be provided with individual store analysis solutions to optimize their content based
            on previous results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can scan products using QR code, barcode, or search by product name, either to search for them in the
            app or to add them (if they have not been added already ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Begs aggregates data from multiple online stores to find users at discounted prices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app can be used with a smart fridge to mark what products are needed with your tablet or phone when they
            are shopping or with a watch to see the shopping list easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application gives bio, local and SME manufacturers the opportunity to list their products for users to
            be informed about them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app suggests certain products using the activity of friends using social media.

        <h3>
            6.1 Brand
        </h3>
        <p>Begs aims to follow the following principles in order to build a sustainable brand</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color</strong> the choice of a good color palette is very important in branding. Color isn’t
                just aesthetics, it stimulates various emotions and carries with it subconscious associations to various
                things and characteristics.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Character</strong> many people in commercialized societies use products and brands to define
                themselves, so shape brand’s character towards something which audience will like to associate
                themselves with.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emotion</strong> uses vibrant colors and beautiful imagery to create a rich and exciting brand
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consistency</strong> throughout design is based on the choices we made earlier in selecting the
                right personality for the brand and evoking the appropriate emotions. Keep consistent colors, visuals
                and printing in full to ensure that the site projects a uniform image.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uniqueness</strong> through the proposed design, we will offer unique product creation, which
                will be remembered among users and will be easier to remember in their minds
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            6.2 Identity
        </h3>
        <p>In order to build and define the identity of our application we have set a representative color that will
            remain in the minds of the users. Starting from the green color, we chose the Complementary pattern and we
            began to define the representative colors of the application.</p>
        <p>To achieve this goal we used the colorizer.org application that suggests the color palette of each design
            pattern</p>
        <p>We chose the colors using the complementary method, thus, the colors as as follows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background: (242,254,217) and complementary being: (229,217,254)</li>
            <li>Buttons: (177,227,77) and complementary being: (127,77,227)</li>
            <li>Border: (140,59,59) and complementary being: (59,140,140)</li>
            <li>Text: (0,0,0) and complementary being: (0,0,0)</li>

        <h1>9 Wireframes</h1>
        <p>
            First of all, the link to our wireframes can be found here, in balsamiq cloud:
            <a href="https://balsamiq.cloud/snq7zq8/ptg44o3">wireframes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again the ideas are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First page and how the user logs in or registers</li>
            <li>How the user selects his interest in the first page (avoid cold start)</li>
            <li>Main page - where the users gets it's recommendations</li>

            <li>Friends activity</li>
            <li>Search</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9.1 First page and how the user logs in or registers</h3>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">

        <p>The design pattern used, splash screens/lunch screen, the user is greeted with the app logo and a friendly
            page to get a friendly welcome</p>
        <p>The next screen isthe tutorial screen</p>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">

        <p>The user will be presented a tutorial of the app, so we will use the design pattern
            tutorial/walkthroughs to help the user learn the app faster.</p>
        <p>After which the user will be greeted by the login page</p>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We used lazy sign-ups to encourage the users to get in he app faster</p>
        <h3>9.2 How the user selects his interest in the first page (avoid cold start)</h3>
        <p>After the user registers, we have to create a profile for him in order to create recommendations.</p>
        <p>To avoid the cold start problem we go through a series of screens to ask him about his preferences in food,
            diets, allergies, quality and so on, on balsamiq is all the flow, we only put one image.</p>
        <figure typeof="sa:Image">

        <p>We used the design pattern: Setup.</p>
        <h3>9.3 Main page - where the users gets it's recommendations</h3>
        <p>The first page is where the user can see the recommendations</p>
        <p>On the bottom of the page there is a sticky nav in order for the user
            to have the application main pages at hand.</p>

        <p>We used a list in order for the information to be more compact and be efficient.</p>
        <p>The user can see the product photo, title, user rating and price an also diverse recommendation tags.</p>
        <h3>9.4 Shopping list that can be shared between the fridge, the smartwatch and phone</h3>
        <p>If the user wants to create a shopping list he has the possibility straight from
            his smart fridge so he won't forget what is he buying.
            He can search for a product via text or voice and also add recommendations by drag and drop.</p>

        <h3>9.5 The shopping cart and how the user places an order</h3>
        <p>If the user clicks on the shopping cart in the sticky nav
            but he doesn't have anything in it we used an empty state
            screen in order for him not to have a blank page, also
            we are showing him some recommendations in order to ease his decision making.</p>
